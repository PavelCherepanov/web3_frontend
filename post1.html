    <h2>BLOCKCHAIN AND CRYPTOCURRENCIES AS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS IN THE MODERN ECONOMY. STATE REGULATION OF CRYPTOCURRENCIES</h2>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>Bitcoin is the first cryptocurrency that appeared in 2009. Since then, 13 years have passed. Interest in this technology has not passed to this day, but on the contrary, it is becoming more and more intense. Financial institutions, government agencies and ordinary people are not only interested in, but invest, actively participate in the development of this technology. Of course, this is due to various factors: global economic instability, a crisis of confidence in the existing banking, financial, payment systems, digitalization and globalization of the economy.</p>
    <p>Cryptocurrency and blockchain technology not only solve many problems, but also give people the opportunity to rethink the meaning and essence of money. Money has three purposes: to be a medium of exchange, a store of value, and a unit of account. Money should be easy to use, divisible, transferable. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies cope with these tasks quite well and have every chance to replace current money.</p>
    <h3>What is a cryptocurrency</h3>
    <p>Cryptocurrency is decentralized digital money based on blockchain technology. This digital money is not tied to the monetary policy of any state, does not depend on any mint, etc.</p>
    <p>Blockchain is a database. It can store information about transactions. This happens in the Bitcoin cryptocurrency blockchain . Information about wallet balances can also be stored, a good example here is the Ethereum cryptocurrency.</p>
    There are three components of a cryptocurrency:
    <ul>
        <li>peer-to-peer network</li>
        <li>cryptography</li>
        <li>consensus mechanisms</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A peer-to-peer network is a computer network built on complete equality of participants. It does not have centralized servers, everything is stored on users' computers. A peer-to-peer network is reliable and self-sufficient. It doesn't have a single point of failure.</p>
    <p>Cryptography is a tool for communicating in the environment of enemies or verifying any information. It helps, for example, to encrypt information. This is a necessary element in a network where it is not known who can be trusted. The main tools of cryptography include hash functions for building a chain of blocks (blockchain), asymmetric cryptography (cryptography with private and public keys), Merkle trees, etc.</p>
    <p>The consensus mechanism is a mechanism for achieving a single decision in the network, who exactly will make changes to the blockchain. Consensus is reached using a protocol. The main ones are: Proof of Work (used in Bitcoin ) and Proof of Stake (used in Ethereum ).</p>
    <h3>Benefits of cryptocurrencies</h3>
    <p>A feature of the cryptocurrency is that transactions between the parties can be made without intermediaries: banks, financial institutions and trusted persons. This increases the speed of transactions, and, importantly, reduces commissions. After all, if you compare a bank transfer from one country to another, the commission will be much higher than if you use cryptocurrency. In the case of banks, you need to pay a commission for transfer, a commission for currency conversion, a commission for a correspondent bank. In cryptocurrency, only miners who validate transactions need to pay.</p>
    <p>The blockchain of most cryptocurrencies is open. Anyone can see the information they need. This is an excellent tool for fighting corruption and transparent work, for example, of financial institutions.</p>
    <p>The open source code of cryptocurrencies increases the transparency of the technology, and also enables anyone to participate in the extraction of virtual currency and the validation of transactions; provides an opportunity to improve technology, suggest changes and corrections.</p>
    <p>Despite the fact that the blockchain is open, it is not known who exactly owns a particular wallet, so cryptocurrency can be called a tool for achieving privacy.</p>
    <p>Cryptocurrency is decentralized. No one regulates its issue and no one controls the movement of funds on the account.</p>
    <p>Cryptocurrencies are a great financial hedge against inflation, as they are issued in limited quantities.</p>
    <h3>Disadvantages of cryptocurrencies</h3>
    <p>Each user is responsible for their own assets. No technical support, regulatory bodies. If the wallet is lost, the cryptocurrency is stolen, it is unlikely to be returned.</p>
    <p>The openness of the blockchain is not only a plus, but also a disadvantage. There are banking secrecy laws. In a system where all information is open, it will be problematic to comply with this law.</p>
    <p>The volatility of cryptocurrencies is another fair disadvantage that prevents the virtual currency from becoming a full-fledged means of payment. The rate of cryptocurrencies depends on many factors: current demand, political, social events, etc. Of course, there are various hedging mechanisms. Some services and sites already accept virtual money for payment using these mechanisms.</p>
    <p>There is also uncertainty in government regulation in different countries, which imposes certain risks on the holders of virtual assets.</p>
    <p>Another of the main problems is the lack of counteraction to money laundering. Cryptocurrency can be used in illegal activities.</p>
    <h3>The use of cryptocurrencies in different countries. Examples. State regulation</h3>
    In addition to the very concept of "cryptocurrency", there are related concepts and areas:
    <ul>
        <li>Mining or staking - mining of cryptocurrency</li>
        <li>Cryptocurrency trading, including for fiat money</li>
        <li>Smart contracts</li>
        <li>stablecoins</li>
        <li>NFTs , etc.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All these are new challenges for traditional, already formed state structures and bodies. Competent and fair regulation is very important now, because these are only developing technologies, which may be the future.</p>
    <p>List of countries where cryptocurrency is legal: Nigeria, Tanzania, Mauritius, Angola, Zimbabwe, Canada, USA, Mexico, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Russian Federation, Republic of Belarus, United Kingdom, Estonia, Germany, Sweden, South Korea, Japan, Ukraine, Israel, Georgia, etc.</p>
    <p>Much depends on the legislation of a particular state. For example, El Salvador is the first country where Bitcoin is an official means of payment.</p>
    <p>On January 1, 2021, the law “On Digital Financial Assets” came into force in the Russian Federation. It recognizes cryptocurrency as property, it is allowed to carry out transactions with its use; it is forbidden to use it as a means of payment. Citizens of the Russian Federation are required to pay tax on the sale of digital money - personal income tax.</p>
    <p>On August 9, 2022, it became known that Iran made the first official import order using cryptocurrency. The Russian Federation can follow the same path. “Digital assets can become a safe alternative that guarantees uninterrupted payment for imports and exports,” - Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin.</p>
    <p>In Argentina, cryptocurrency shows itself as a reliable means of protecting against inflation. Many citizens own it legally.</p>
    <p>The Argentine Republic is a rapidly developing agro-industrial state in South America. This country has had a very high inflation rate since the 1980s. Wences Casares is a citizen of this country, as well as an entrepreneur, philanthropist and supporter of cryptocurrencies.</p>
    <p>“Growing up with Wences, Argentina was almost constantly in a state of another financial crisis. In 1983, after years of runaway inflation, the government created a new peso equal to the previous 10,000. This measure did not bring any result, and in 1985 the new peso replaced the austral, which was equal to 1000 new pesos. Seven years later, unbridled inflation forced the government to return the peso, this time pegging it to the dollar, sparking another catastrophic financial crisis. Throughout this time, inflation regularly reached 100% per year, that is, the population's money in banks annually depreciated at least twice. ”</p>
    <p>In a number of countries, there has not yet been an official decision on the regulation and legal regime of cryptocurrencies.</p>
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>Cryptocurrency is a very new technology, with great potential for use in different areas. Although there are still many problems that I think will be solved. And it's not just about the technology itself, but also about state regulation, public opinion. It is very important to earn the trust of the majority of people.</p>
